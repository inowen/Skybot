This bot works with crops that use seeds specifically, like beetroot and wheat.

I'll attempt to make its actions more sensible in the grand scheme, not like the first crop bot.

The size of the region that will be broken should depend on the size of the farm in total, for example.

Apart from that, it will focus on stability. All relevant states will have timers to reset them, in case the bot gets stuck somewhere.

(I'm leaving the readme here since the bot isn't done yet, so REMOVE IT once the bot is implemented)
